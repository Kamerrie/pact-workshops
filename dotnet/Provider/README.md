## Where is this from?
https://github.com/YOU54F/pact-workshops/tree/main/dotnet/Provider

## Summary
TestStartup.cs shows us that we are using Middleware (hooks) to set up the test cases provided by the client's contract. In Middleware we see the ProviderState Model, and ProviderStateMiddleware.cs where see that using the ProviderState visible in our Pact contract (generated by the Client's tests), we complete the 'Given' parts of our tests cases. In this case we create a list, but I don't presently see why this couldnt be an INSERT orrrr maybe even a POST request. 

In ProductTest.cs, we see that we state the pact file being used for this test, and we give the name/ID of our Service for the Pact Verifier.


## TODO
1. CI/CD flow
2. Potentially separate API and Test projects into different repos for this.
    a. this is because we will most probably not need these in the same repo, and having them in separate ones makes it easier to keep track of where the tests are, and to give the tests their own CI/CD steps.
3. Finish the remaining steps from the workshops.
4. Add an extra test implementation from the client, so that we can write one here, where we test interaction with a message queue.
5. Fix pactFile to have a Path in the repo.
